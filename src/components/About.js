      <p>
        Hello! I'm a passionate and driven Electricals student at Silicon Institute of Technology with a strong interest in web development and modern technologies.
         I enjoy building responsive and interactive web applications using tools like React, JavaScript, and Node.js. 
         With a deep curiosity for learning and a commitment to writing clean, efficient code, I aim to grow into a well-rounded full-stack developer.
          I thrive on challenges, love exploring new technologies, and am excited to contribute to impactful, real-world projects. Letâ€™s build something amazing together!
